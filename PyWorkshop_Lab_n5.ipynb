    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we‚Äôll explore two foundational concepts in Python: **Conditionals** and **Loops**. These structures are essential tools for controlling the flow of a program, enabling it to make decisions, handle repetitive tasks, and respond dynamically to different inputs or conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are Conditionals and Loops Important? üîç\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conditionals** allow your program to make decisions based on specific conditions, using statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else`. This capability enables your code to follow multiple pathways, adapting its behavior according to different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loops** provide a way to automate repetitive tasks, which is critical in data processing, analysis, and countless other applications. With **`for` loops**, you can iterate through data structures like lists, and with **`while` loops**, you can repeat tasks until certain conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "These structures are the backbone of any programming pipeline, allowing you to build solutions that are flexible, efficient, and scalable. By mastering conditionals and loops, you‚Äôll unlock the ability to handle complex workflows and create more intelligent, adaptive programs. \n",

    "1. **`for` loops**: Used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, or string) and executing a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",
