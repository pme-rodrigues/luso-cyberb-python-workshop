    "However, working with **escape characters** like backslashes (`\\`) can pose some problems when dealing with certain text, such as file paths. For example, if we want to define a file path like `C:\\Users\\Documents\\new_folder`, we would need to escape the backslashes, because in Python, the backslash is used as an escape character.\n",

    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "path = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Documents\\\\new_folder\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### Raw Strings to the Rescue\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **raw strings** come in handy! Raw strings make it easier to work with backslashes by treating them **literally**, so you don't have to escape them. To create a raw string, you simply prefix the string with an `r`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "path = r\"C:\\Users\\Documents\\new_folder\"  # No need to escape the backslashes\n",

This means we can, if we want, access each square of a string, using square brakects. There are various ways of idnexig in Python, but we will save those for the next class.
