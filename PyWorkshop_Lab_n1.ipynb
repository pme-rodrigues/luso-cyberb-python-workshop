    "## What is Jupyter Notebook ‚ùî\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain **live code**, **equations**, **visualizations**, and **explanatory text**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's widely used for:\n",
    "- **Data cleaning and transformation** üßπ\n",
    "- **Numerical simulation** üßÆ\n",
    "- **Statistical modeling** üìä\n",
    "- **Machine learning** ü§ñ\n",
    "- **Visualization** üìà\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features üîë:\n",
    "- **Interactive coding**: Write and execute code in a step-by-step manner.\n",
    "- **Markdown support**: Use markdown to write notes, explanations, and documentation alongside your code.\n",
    "- **Rich output**: Display charts, plots, tables, and even images within the notebook itself.\n",
    "- **Supports multiple languages**: The most common is Python, but Jupyter also supports other languages like **R** and Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it popular üì∏?\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is popular among data scientists, researchers, and educators because it allows for an **interactive, narrative-driven** coding experience. It‚Äôs a great tool for **experimenting** with code, **documenting** your process, and **sharing** your findings."

    "\n",
    "In Jupyter Notebooks, there are 3 types of cells you can work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1Ô∏è‚É£ **Code cells**: These are the most common and are used to write and run Python code. Once you write your code, hit Shift + Enter or press the \"Run\" button <img src=\"images/runButton.PNG\" alt=\"Run Code\" style=\"vertical-align: middle; height: 15px;\"> to execute it. The output will be displayed right below the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "2Ô∏è‚É£ **Markdown cells**: These allow you to write formatted text. You can use Markdown syntax to style your text, add lists, headers, or even embed images and links. For example, the text you're reading right now is inside a markdown cell. Double-click this cell to see its raw contents and edit as you like. After making changes, press the \"Run\" button to render the formatted version again.\n",
    "\n",
    "3Ô∏è‚É£ **Raw cells**: These contain text that is not meant to be executed or formatted. They can be useful for adding notes or other information without rendering it as Markdown or running it as code."

    "\n",
    "#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Headings and Titles\n",
    "You can define different title levels by using the `#` symbol, with the number of `#` signs corresponding to the heading level. Here‚Äôs an example:\n",
    "\n",

    "# Title 1\n",

    "To emphasize parts of your text, you can use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bold**: Surround the text with double asterisks `**` or underscores `__`.  \n",
    "  Example: `**This is bold**` ‚û°Ô∏è **This is bold**\n",
    "  \n",
    "- _Italic_: Wrap your text with single asterisks `*` or underscores `_`.  \n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperlinks üîó\n",
    "You can insert hyperlinks to external websites or even link to specific sections within your notebook, which greatly improves navigation!\n",
    "\n",
    "For external links:  \n",

    "[Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org)\n",
    "```\n",
    "‚û°Ô∏è [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org)\n",

    "### Save Your Work! üíæ\n",

    "While working with Jupyter Notebooks, it's essential to **save your progress** regularly because Jupyter doesn't automatically save your work for you. To save your notebook, simply click the **Save** button <img src=\"images/save.PNG\" alt=\"Save Button\" style=\"vertical-align: middle; height: 22px;\"> in the toolbar, or use the shortcut `Ctrl + S` (or `Cmd + S` on Mac).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Go to the **File** menu.\n",
